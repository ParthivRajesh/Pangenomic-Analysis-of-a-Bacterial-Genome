# Pangenomic-Analysis-of-a-Bacterial-Genome
This project implements a complete pangenome analysis pipeline for Pantoea agglomerans, starting from raw NCBI genomes, annotating them with Prokka, and generating core-accessory gene clustering using Roary with downstream visualization. It provides an end-to-end, fully reproducible workflow.
